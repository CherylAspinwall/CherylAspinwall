Hi! My name is Cheryl, I'm a brand new Tech Elevator student. I'm also a newbie to coding in general so go easy on me!

I think continuing to learn new things and be challenged are the things that keep life exciting so I'm really looking forward to embarking on this journey.

When I'm not working on this or my current day job I'm usually spending time with my dog, friends, family, or any combination of those things.
